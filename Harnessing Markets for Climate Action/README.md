## Introduction

In recent decades, the need to address climate change urgently has grown, inspiring a global call to action. Carbon trading is a widely accepted strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using market mechanisms. This approach assigns a monetary value to carbon emissions, encouraging businesses to cut their greenhouse gas output.

Carbon markets, including emission trading systems and baseline-and-credit systems, are key tools for climate change mitigation. These systems allow companies to buy and sell permits to emit carbon, aiming to reduce emissions cost-effectively.

### Blockchain and Carbon Trading

Blockchain technology offers a promising solution to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and trustworthiness of carbon markets. It provides a secure and unchangeable framework for logging and validating transactions, making it ideal for managing complex carbon markets.

By using blockchain, stakeholders can create an auditable and transparent record of carbon emissions, offsets, and trading activities. This technology helps ensure the smooth operation of carbon markets by securely issuing, recording, and trading carbon credits in real-time with digital tokens and smart contracts.

### Benefits and Challenges

Despite its potential, blockchain solutions in this field are still maturing. However, they hold significant promise in addressing the shortcomings of current carbon markets and unlocking their full potential for climate action.
